Hi, I am Jingye Xu, first year Ph.D. student in the [Algorithm, Combinatorics and Optimization](https://aco.gatech.edu/) program at Georgia Tech. I have a broad interest in the intersection of algorithm, combintorics and optimization. Currently, I am working on mixed-integer programming. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Santanu S. Dey](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~sdey30/) and [Diego Cifuentes](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/diego-cifuentes-pardo).

Before coming to Georgia Tech, I received my Bachelor on computer science at [David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science of University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/). During my undergraduate, I am fortunate to work on semidefinite programming with 
[Levent Tun√ßel](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~ltuncel/) and [Stephen A. Vavasis](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/vavasis/home) from department of Combinatorics and Optimization.
